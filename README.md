==========

Official Shade-C EVO Repository

Please get in contact if you want to help with the project! Even non coders might help in the form of filling the Wiki with content and tutorials.


PLEASE NOTE:
Shade-C EVO is NOT free!
You can test it as long as you like however.
Once you start publishing images/videos/demos of your project which uses Shade-C, you need a license.
If helping other Shade-C users, posting bugs or anything like that, a license is not needed.
If your project is open source, a license is not needed.
If you add new features to Shade-C, fix bugs or write tutorials you will get a free license. Please get in contact if you do so.

!! If enough people start working on Shade-C (bugfixing, new features, tutorials and manual/wiki), it will become fully free and the need for a license will be abandoned. So don't hesitate to ask for write access for the git repository !!
